# Automated attendance systems overview


## Introduction


Automated embedded systems and technolgies are considered to be a huge success on business industry as we see nowadays; We can see that such systems become so critical to provide legacy and to increase effeciency too. Therefore, such an attendance management system (**AMS**) is a very important component that ensure organisation effeciency and productivity.

**AMS** enables businesses to track access and attandence. It helps businesses monitor leaves and abscence records overtime,  and collect important data to improve events effenciency and to balance budget for upcoming events too. We attende on this paper to look up on different strategies and technologies proposed of **AMS** while mentioning disadvantages of each, suggest solutions and improve existing modules effeciency.

### Technologies

We will discuss the following technologies on depth in the upcoming chapters.

- **Bar Code** : a barcode is a type of one line two dimensional (2D) code that enables quick response through scanning.<sup>[1](https://dmsiworks.com/blog/barcodes-vs-qr-codes-which-is-better-for-manufacturers)</sup>
- **QR Code** : a qr code is a type of multi line two-dimensional (2D) code that enables quick response and store multiple or long data forms (such as website links, password, ect..).<sup>[1](https://dmsiworks.com/blog/barcodes-vs-qr-codes-which-is-better-for-manufacturers)</sup>
- **Biometrics** : Biometrics identification is the process of verifying a person identity through their unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints.<sup>[2](https://www.innovatrics.com/glossary/biometric-identification/#:~:text=Biometric%20identification%20is%20the%20process%20of%20verifying%20a%20person's%20identity,%2C%20facial%20recognition%2C%20and%20voiceprints.)</sup>
- **Radio-Frequency identification (RFID)** : RFID is a short-range communication technology that use electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in radio frequency to identify an object.<sup>[3](https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/RFID-radio-frequency-identification)</sup>
- **Near Field Communication (NFC)** : NFC is a short-range communication protocol that enables a device (such as a phone) to act as a transit pass or a credit card and quickly transfer data too.<sup>[4](https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-nfc-270730/)</sup>
